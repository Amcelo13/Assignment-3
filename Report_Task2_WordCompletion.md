# Task 2: Word Completion Using Tries - Report

## Overview
Implements autocomplete/word completion using Trie data structure for efficient prefix-based search.

## Implementation

### Data Structure: Trie (Prefix Tree)
- Each node represents a character
- Boolean flag marks word endings
- Children stored in HashMap for O(1) character lookup

### Algorithm

**Insert**: O(m) where m = word length
**Search Prefix**: O(p) where p = prefix length  
**Collect Words**: O(k) where k = number of results

### Features
1. Prefix-based word search
2. Returns all matching completions
3. Sorted results alphabetically
4. Word count statistics

## Performance

| Operation | Time Complexity |
|-----------|----------------|
| Insert | O(m) |
| Find Completions | O(p + k) |
| Count Words | O(n) |

## Test Cases
- "car" → car, card, cards, care, cargo, etc.
- "rent" → rental, rentals, rent, renting, etc.
- "can" → canada, canadian, canal, etc.

## Applications
- Search engines
- IDE code completion
- Mobile keyboard predictions
- Command-line autocomplete

## Conclusion
Trie-based word completion provides fast, efficient autocomplete with O(p + k) complexity.
